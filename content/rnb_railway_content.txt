Blues origins belong in the deep south of the USA, among the slaves. Once freed these slaves took to the railways for escape, freedom and work. The induction of Sister Rosetta Tharpe's 1939 classic "This Train" into the Grammy Hall of Fame gives an acknowledged link to the “Blues and the Railways.” What better way to celebrate this link than in the home town where the first steam hauled passenger railway journey took place back in 1825.


Some great Blues tunes were inspired by black migrants travelling on trains up to the great northern cities of America looking for a better life. Located only a ten-minute walk from Darlington’s Bank Top Railway Station, Darlington Rhythm ’n’ Blues Club hold their monthly gigs at the Forum Music Centre in Borough Road, Darlington.
